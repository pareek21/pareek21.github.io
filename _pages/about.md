I am a PhD student (2023-present) at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), advised by Prof. [Simon Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) and Prof. [Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/). I am broadly interested in fundamental aspects of machine learning. This includes a principled understanding of learning algorithms and their statistical and computational properties. This also involves discovery and analysis of interesting phenomena that arise in modern learning paradigms.

Previously, I worked on quantitative investment research at [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/)'s GQS division. I got my Masters degree in Machine Learning from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/), and my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/).
