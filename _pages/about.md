Hello! I am a PhD student (2023-present) at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), advised by Prof. [Simon Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) and Prof. [Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/). I am broadly interested in fundamental aspects of machine learning. This includes a principled understanding of learning algorithms and their statistical and computational properties. This also involves discovery and analysis of interesting phenomena that arise in modern learning paradigms.

Previously, I worked in quantitative investment research at GQS, [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/). I got my master's in Machine Learning from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/), and my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), with a minor in Statistics.
